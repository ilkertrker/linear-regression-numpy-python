It is a project of Coursera Course of mine. 


Linear Regression with NumPy and Python
Now, we you will  implement gradient descent and linear regression from scratch using NumPy and Python, so you have a deeper understanding of the fundamentals of machine learning. We will accomplish this with the help of following tasks in the project:

Task 1: Introduction and Import Libraries

Task 2: Load the Data and Libraries

Task 3: Visualize the Data

Task 4: Compute the Cost 𝐽(𝜃)

Task 5: Implement Gradient Descent from scratch in Python

Task 6: Visualizing the Cost Function J(𝜃)

Task 7: Plotting the Convergence

Task 8: Training Data with Univariate Linear Regression Fit

Task 9: Inference using the optimized 𝜃 values
